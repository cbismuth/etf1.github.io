## Schema

We used excalidraw to produce our schemas: [https://excalidraw.com/](https://excalidraw.com/)

Don't forget to push the original file to the repository (example : https://github.com/etf1/etf1.github.io/blob/prez-archi-mytf1/content/post/2020/architecture/presentation/images/persisted-queries.excalidraw)

Once your schema is OK you can export it as a SVG file and compress it with [https://vecta.io/nano](https://vecta.io/nano).
